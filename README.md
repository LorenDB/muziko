# Muziko

Muziko is an app designed to help you practice playing any musical instrument. It does so by taking all the songs you know and giving you a list of songs every day based on how well you know each song.

## Get the app

Muziko is in the preliminary development stages, so you'll have to build from source. Someday, however, you should be able to get Muziko from the Google Play Store, as well as find builds for other platforms here on GitHub. Check back in a while to see if that has happened yet :)

## Building

Muziko is built with C++ and Qt, so once you have installed a standard Qt building toolchain, run the normal `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build .` to build Muziko. Or you could open the project in Qt Creator and build it that way, which probably would be the easiest way to build for Android.

## Screenshots

There are no screenshots now because the UI is under heavy development. Sorry!
